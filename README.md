# Task 4 â€“ Sentiment Analysis  
**PRODIGY INFOTECH (Internship - Data Science)**

This repository contains **Task 4** of my Data Science Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**. The task focuses on performing **sentiment analysis** on tweets using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Task Outline

Analyze sentiments from a given Twitter dataset using data cleaning, preprocessing, and sentiment scoring. The task involves:
- Preprocessing tweets by removing noise such as URLs, mentions, hashtags, and stopwords
- Applying the VADER sentiment analyzer to extract sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral, compound)
- Visualizing the number of tweets per category using bar charts

## Knowledge Acquired

Through this task, I enhanced my understanding of:
- Text preprocessing techniques using NLTK
- Applying sentiment analysis using the VADER lexicon
- Visualizing tweet distribution by category
- Handling real-world noisy text data
